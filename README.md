Taro is a virtual Pet Simulator game specifically for kids aged 6-12. Primary target of this project is to encourage kids to active participate household chores and other tasks asigned by parents while keeping the whole experience fun for them. 

## Gameplay 🎮

### Children's role

There  are 4 main types of Taros or Pets. These being - 
- Dog 🐶
- Cat 😸
- Penguin 🐧
- Ox 🐂

The Primary Interactions that can be made with the are -
- feeding
- cleaning
- excersize
- Sleep

There are 4  main metrics that needed to be taken care of these are - 
 - Hunger 🍗
 - Stamina 💪
 - Mood 😀
 - Living Conditions 🏠
 
Taro require food time to time. They have a hunger bar of 240 points (320 for  fat variants or 160 for thin variants) 240 being the stomach full while 0 indicates empty stomach. They need to eat food time to time which restores 80 Hunger Points. 10 hunger points depleats every hour (7 for thin and 14 for fat variants) A Taro starts feeling hungry after hunger points is gone below 25% if hunger doesn't goes up the limit within 5 min Tarro goes in Malnourished State. A malnourished Tarro need twice the amount of food to replinish it's hunger, It takes 3 continous in game days to keep it above 25% hunger bar to taro recover from malnutrion if not recovered from malnutrion within this time frame Taro dies. Stamina drain also increases to 1.5%. While the oposite happenns when hunger point is above 90% for 30min, the taro goes into Obese mode. Obese Taro needs twice the time to complete exercises also hunger points depletes twice as first. Obesety needs to be tend within two days by keeping the hunger points under 90% else the taro dies. obese or malnutrioned Taro also looses mood points **It is wise to keep the hunger points withinh 30 to 80 % range**.

Like any healthy pet, Taros need to do excersize for a healthy life style. Taro owner needs to play skiping rope with Taro game. If a excersie is successfull the owner recieves 10 Tarodollar(more in currency section). A regularly excercized Taro will have a mood boost while not excersing will decrease the mood. It also consume 30 stamina(max stamina  120). if Stamina goes below 20 The Taro becomes exhausted. Taro needs sleep to replenish Stamina.

Like every other pet Taros made filth just by existing. they produce 5 to 10 filth per day. also excersizing makes them dirty too. There are two things to keep the living conditions good. owners must clean the filth by taping on the filth. also Taping the cleaning button can make the Taros' dirt go away. As more filth gathers in pen or on Taro itself, Living COndition points detoriate (range 0 - 255). If a Taro lives in poor living condition(less than 20 points) the Taro gets a mood debuff.

Mood depends on all afformentioned factors. Calculated as a weighted average of all the previous factors. It is the most important factor of the Game as the final Mood of the taro is the end result of the Game.

### Parents' Role

Parents would have to post chores for their child daily and assing a bounty for completing them. Bounty could range anywhere from 10 to 100 TaroDollar 

When a child completes a task parents need to aprove it then the payment would be made.
